\usage{
scrape_total_points(html_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{html_filename}{Path to HTML file of Canvas page, recommended to place HTML file in the
same folder as where this is being used. Can also take Canvas HTML link but may not work due to
log-ins sometimes.}
}
\value{
A one column dataframe that has all the total points from Canvas. Note that if the
grade book is not complete then there may be null/missing values in the column. I
recommend you fix those by hand to match whatever you're doing.
